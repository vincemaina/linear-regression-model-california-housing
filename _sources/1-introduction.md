# Introduction

In this research project I'll be training a linear regression model on the 1990 California Housing dataset.

The purpose of this project is to loosely follow the steps a machine learning engineer might carry out when training a machine learning model. I'll be training my model on real data, which is imperfect (with noise and anomalies) and trickier to draw strong conclusions from.

In particular, I'll be focusing on applying the following skills:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Data visualisation in python using tools like matplotlib and seaborn
- Data handling and manipulation using tools like pandas
- Dataset comprehension and feature selection
- Training linear regression models
- Tuning linear regression models to avoid noise, anomalies, overfitting, underfitting etc

Further, if the opportunity presents itself to learn and apply any **statistical anaylsis** techniques, this is also something I'd be interested in exploring.
